# How to Report an Issue

If you would like to report a problem you find when using `you-get`, please open a [Pull Request](https://github.com/soimort/you-get/pulls), which should include:

1. A detailed description of the encountered problem;

2. At least one commit, addressing the problem through some unit test(s).

   * Examples of good commits: [#2675](https://github.com/soimort/you-get/pull/2675/files), [#2680](https://github.com/soimort/you-get/pull/2680/files), [#2685](https://github.com/soimort/you-get/pull/2685/files)

PRs that fail to meet the above criteria may be closed summarily with no further action.

A valid PR will remain open until its addressed problem is fixed.
