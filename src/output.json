To create a clear, logical, and aesthetically pleasing diagram, we should use a top-down flow for the main phases,\n with horizontal expansions to detail the internal steps within each phase.\n\nBelow is a structured guide and a visual representation that you can easily recreate in tools like Microsoft PowerPoint, Visio\n, draw.io, or Adobe Illustrator.\n\n### Visual Design Guidelines (Aesthetics & Style)\n\n*   **Font:** Use a clean, professional sans-serif\n font throughout (e.g., Helvetica, Arial, Calibri, or Open Sans).\n*   **Color Palette:** Use a professional, cool palette to differentiate phases.\n\n    *   *Preparation & Output (Start/End):* Neutral Grey or muted Gold.\n    *   *Phase 1 (Lit Review):* Blue\n.\n    *   *Phase 2 (Survey):* Teal or Green.\n    *   *Phase 3 (Synthesis):* Purple or Indigo (representing the\n blending of Blue and Green).\n*   **Shapes:**\n    *   *Main Phases:* Large rectangular containers with bold headers.\n    *   *Process\n Steps:* Smaller rectangles with rounded corners inside the main containers.\n    *   *Data/Inputs:* Parallelograms or distinct lighter-colored boxes.\n\n*   **Connectors:** Use thick, bold arrows for the main flow between phases. Use thinner arrows for internal steps.\n\n---\n\n### The Method Diagram Structure\n\n\nHere is the text-based graphical representation of the diagram flow.\n\n#### [TOP CONTAINER: RESEARCH PREPARATION]\n**(Color: Neutral Grey)**\n\n**Heading\n: I.
