CommentCoreLibrary welcomes all developers to contribute to the project in any 

way, such as code, documentation or issue reports. This document describes how 

you can effectively contribute to make our work easier.

Please use the issue tracker provided by Github to submit bug reports. These 

include any compatibility problems, script generated errors, display problems

etc. English or Chinese issue reports are both welcome and accepted. Descibe the 

problem as clearly as possible in the title too. Also, for display and 

compatibility problems please also include your browser vendor and OS info.

PS: Just as heads up, check your font support first. Unix based systems often 

choke on Chinese font names and render some fixed point animations wrong, this 

may happen if you don't have fonts configured correctly. You should install the 

basic Chinese font SimHei for accurate positioning of comments.

You can also use the issue tracker to submit feature requests, implementation 

discussions and development questions. Remember that CCL is just a comment 

overlay, for problems concerning video, backwards compatability with pre-HTML5 

and flash fallback, please report to ABPlayerHTML5 or other corresponding 

projects.
