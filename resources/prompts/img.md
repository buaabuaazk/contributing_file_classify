Please help me generate a method diagram for my paper, using sans serif fonts with clear logic and aesthetically pleasing structure. The following is the methodology and process of the paper:
The study adopts a mixed-method research design, with the core process divided into three main phases: "Literature Review", "Online Survey with Researchers", and "Synthesis and Analysis of Results". The detailed steps are as follows:

I. Research Preparation: Define Core Questions
First, three key research questions (RQ1-RQ3) are identified, focusing on the "recruitment methods", "ethical concerns", and "handling strategies" of online surveys in Software Engineering (SE), laying the foundation for subsequent research.
II. Phase 1: Literature Review (Quantitative + Qualitative Annotation)
Literature Screening: Search for papers from 4 top SE conferences (ICSE, FSE, etc.) and 3 core journals (TSE, TOSEM, etc.) published between 2022 and 2025 using keywords "online survey" and "questionnaire". Initially, 1,132 papers are obtained; after removing duplicates and non-research-related literature, 340 valid papers are finally selected.
Literature Annotation: Two researchers independently annotate six core attributes of each paper—target participants, recruitment methods (including classification), ethical considerations (including classification), research topic, and authors’ email addresses. Disagreements in annotation are resolved by a third researcher, and if consensus is still not reached, a fourth researcher makes the final decision.
Email Extraction: Extract 1,215 unique and valid authors’ email addresses from the 340 papers, serving as the invitation pool for the subsequent researcher survey.
III. Phase 2: Online Survey with Researchers (Empirical Data Collection)
Questionnaire Design: A 33-question questionnaire is designed based on literature review results, divided into 5 parts (ethical issues in research design, participant recruitment, experience as questionnaire recipients, demographics, postscript), including 1 attention check question (to filter invalid responses). The questionnaire is approved by the institutional ethics committee and pre-tested by 5 senior SE researchers to optimize clarity and length.
Questionnaire Distribution: Invitations are sent to 1,215 authors’ email addresses, explaining the research purpose, estimated completion time (10-15 minutes), voluntary participation, and data confidentiality. A second reminder is sent 20 days later, with each round of invitations lasting 2 weeks. Finally, 1,083 invitations are successfully sent, 60 responses are received, and 6 invalid responses that fail the attention check are excluded, leaving 54 valid questionnaires (effective response rate of approximately 5%).
Data Processing:
Quantitative data (e.g., frequency of recruitment method use, ethical risk scores) is analyzed using descriptive statistics.
IV. Phase 3: Synthesis and Analysis of Results (Triangulation)
A triangulation approach is adopted to systematically integrate findings from the literature review and online survey:
For RQ1 (Recruitment Methods): The literature review provides an overall trend, while survey data validates and supplements emerging practices.
For RQ2 (Ethical Concerns): Ethical challenges reported in the literature are combined with researchers’ actual perceptions reflected in the survey to compare differences between theory and practice.
For RQ3 (Ethical Handling Practices): Specific response measures from the survey are interpreted in the context of existing literature to highlight practical approaches and gaps in current guidance.
V. Output: Research Findings and Recommendations
Based on the integrated analysis, 7 key findings are derived, and targeted ethical practice recommendations are provided for 5 stakeholder groups: researchers, ethics committees, academic publishers, platform managers, and participants.
